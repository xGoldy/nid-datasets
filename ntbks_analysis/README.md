# Datasets Analyses Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing datasets and extracting information for the survey's paper comparative table. Their primary purpose is to provide an overview of the data without downloading. However, they have a few limitations, as described below.

## Datasets and Associated Notebooks

This table contains the name of the dataset (1st column) and its associated Jupyter Notebook filename (2nd column). If an associated notebook for a given dataset does not exist, the value `-` is provided. The notebooks are sorted by their data collection year and then alphabetically - same as in the survey paper.

_Work-in-progress: The rest (20 notebooks since 70th position) will be added in the 1st week of March._

## Notebooks Limitations

Initially, these notebooks for data analysis were not purposed to be publicly shared. However, we later realized their potential value for the community. We thus shared the notebooks in the end, but unfortunately, this sharing mindset was adopted rather late in the reviewing process. While not directly affecting the comparative table itself, it brings two major implications for the notebooks:

* **No standard structure is followed**: Initially, our notebooks were mainly goal-driven - focusing on extracting key dataset details (most notably duration, number of classes, and data size) rather than analyzing the data. Later as we decided to share the data, additional data analysis steps were introduced. However, as each dataset is unique, different analysis steps were required. These facts lead to structural discrepancies among the notebooks.

* **Notebooks are not present for every dataset**: Since the analysis was initially not intended for sharing, some datasets, especially those with only raw PCAP data, were analyzed only via the command line and scripts without saved output. As a result, not all datasets have an associated Jupyter notebook.
